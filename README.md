# 👗 Fashion Studio  
**AI-Powered Fashion Design Assistant**

Fashion Studio is an intelligent fashion design assistant that uses **Generative AI** to transform raw fashion ideas into refined concepts, realistic visuals, trend insights, cost estimates, and sustainability-aware outputs — all within a single, intuitive web application.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

The fashion industry is highly dynamic and trend-driven. Designers often spend significant time on:
- Concept ideation and refinement  
- Trend research  
- Design visualization  
- Production cost estimation  
- Sustainability considerations  

For beginners and independent designers, access to professional, integrated design tools is limited. Most existing solutions are fragmented, complex, or expensive.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**Fashion Studio** provides a unified AI-powered platform that:

- Enhances fashion design ideas using Generative AI  
- Generates realistic fashion design images  
- Performs AI-based trend analysis  
- Creates automated mood boards with color palettes and fabric suggestions  
- Estimates production cost breakdowns  
- Provides sustainability scoring  
- Suggests similar product references  

---

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Architecture:** Modular and scalable  
- **AI Integration:** External APIs for text and image generation  
- **Security:** Secure API key management via configuration files  

Each feature is implemented as an independent module, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and future scalability.

## 🧠 Algorithm & Deployment

### Algorithms Used
- **Text-Based Tasks:** Gemini Large Language Model  
  - Idea enhancement  
  - Trend analysis  
  - Mood board generation  

- **Image Generation:** Stable Diffusion  
  - Implemented via Hugging Face Inference API  

### Deployment
- Deployed locally using **Streamlit**  
- Runs on a local server and accessed through a web browser  
- Designed for future deployment on:
  - Streamlit Community Cloud  
  - Cloud platforms
